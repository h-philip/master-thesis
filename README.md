# Masters Thesis Implementation

This is the code that was implemented as part of my computer science master's thesis.
In this thesis, I designed, implemented, and verified an optimal controller for a quadcopter delivery drone.
Specifically, the problem of constrained optimal control of a quadcopter drone was formalized in a model of a Hybrid Automaton.
For this automaton, an algorithm was designed to synthesize the optimal controller using Dynamic Programming.
Verification of the controller's correctness was performed using formal methods.
